# Lab 5 - GPU Parallel Computing - K-means

A practical introduction to heterogeneous programming, this excercise focuses on the differences between CPU and GPU programming.
We implement the algorithm introduced in Labs 2 and 3 using CUDA and execute them on a single GPU. Through simple optimization techniques, we try to achieve better performance on both computation and communication stages. 

The main conclusion is that GPU programming, while similar to CPU programming, requires careful attention to detail to achieve good performance due to the significant architectural differences between the processors.
